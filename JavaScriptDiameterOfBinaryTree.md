# JavaScript Diameter of Binary Tree

## Challenge:

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

### 1<sup>st</sup> Example:

`Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]`
<br/>
`Output: 3`
<br/>
`Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].`

### 2<sup>nd</sup> Example:

`Input: root = [1,2]`
<br/>
`Output: 1`

### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10‚Å¥]`.
<br/>
`-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution:

`const diameterOfBinaryTree = (root) => {`
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`let diameter = 0;`
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`const depth = (root) => {`
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`if (!root) return 0;`
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`let left  = depth(root.left),`
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`right = depth(root.right);`
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`diameter = Math.max(diameter, left + right);`
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`return longerSide = Math.max(left, right) + 1;`
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`};`
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`depth(root);`
<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`return diameter;`
<br/>
`};`
<br/>
<br/>

## Explanation:

I've coded a function that calculates the diameter of a binary tree. The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.
<br/>

The `diameterOfBinaryTree` function takes the root of the binary tree as input. It initializes the `diameter` variable to 0.
<br/>

Inside the `diameterOfBinaryTree` function, there is a nested function called `depth`. This function calculates the depth of a node in the binary tree.
<br/>

Within the `depth` function, it first checks if the current node is null. If it is, it returns 0.
<br/>

Next, the `depth` function recursively calls itself on the left and right child of the current node and stores the results in the `left` and `right` variables.
<br/>

The `diameter` variable is then updated by taking the maximum of its current value and the sum of `left` and `right`. This allows it to keep track of the longest path encountered so far.
<br/>

Finally, the `depth` function returns the maximum of `left` and `right` plus 1, which represents the depth of the current node.
<br/>

After defining the `depth` function, the `depth` function is called with the root of the binary tree to calculate the depth of each node.
<br/>

The final value of the `diameter` variable is returned as the result of the `diameterOfBinaryTree` function, representing the diameter of the binary tree.
<br/>

In summary, this function uses a recursive approach to calculate the diameter of a binary tree. It defines a nested function called `depth` to calculate the depth of each node, and updates the `diameter` variable to keep track of the longest path encountered. The final diameter of the binary tree is returned as the output of the function.
